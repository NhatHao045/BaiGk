   <p>
      I am currently a third-year Information Technology student at NTT Institute of International Education (NIIE), Nguyen Tat Thanh University. Throughout my studies, Iâ€™ve gained knowledge in programming, web design, databases, and software development.</p>

    <p>
Besides classroom learning, I actively participate in group projects, assignments, and online courses to improve my practical skills and better understand the web development process.</p>

    <p>
      I always strive to keep learning and stay up to date with the fast-changing tech world, preparing myself for future career opportunities.</p>
    <p>Thanks For Watching!</p>
