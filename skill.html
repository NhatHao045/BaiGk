   <p>
      I am a third-year Information Technology student with a passion for web design. I enjoy creating beautiful, user-friendly websites that provide a great experience for visitors.</p>
    <p>
    I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I’m familiar with Bootstrap and React to build modern, responsive interfaces optimized for mobile devices. I often practice through personal projects to improve my skills
    <p>
I highly value teamwork, as I believe effective collaboration helps projects progress faster and achieve better results. I’m always willing to listen, share, and support my teammates when working together.
