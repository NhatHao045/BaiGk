   <p>
      Although I am still a student, I have participated in various group projects at school related to web interface design and frontend programming. I played a key role in layout building, responsive design, and user experience optimization.
    <p>
      I’ve also developed personal projects such as a portfolio website, landing pages, and a simple blog using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects helped me improve my problem-solving and independent working skills.
    <p>
       Through these experiences, I’ve learned how to plan efficiently, adapt to challenges, and collaborate effectively in team environments.</p>
    <p>Thanks For Watching!</p>
